          A Class Attribute allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we
          choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class
          selector. The combination of the selector and the attribute is called a 'ruleset'

        <li>Creates the style of the webpage.</li>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets is a language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML.</li>
<li>The whole structure is called a 'ruleset' : There is the Selector (name at the start of the ruleset, often just referred to as a 'rule') and the Declaration. </li>
<li>To change/style a different element, change the selector/rule. </li>
<li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces({})</li>
<li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
<li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
<li>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons. </li>
<li>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. </li>
<li>Separate multiple selectors by commas.</li>
<li>Different types of selectors are- Element selector (sometimes called a tag or type selector)</li>
<li>Other types of selectors: ID selector, Class selector, Attribute Selector, Pseudo-calss selector. </li>
