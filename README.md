## Description

Created this website to get my feet wet and understand some of the terminology and what was expected of me in the upcoming immersive classes. I built this project because I need it for maximum learning capabilities. The results are amazing, to say the least, I have come a long way in such a short time just by following the directions in the tutorial and meeting with a tutor whenever there was an issue. The student support of this boot camp is unbelievable. I really feel good about this boot camp and everything will be manageable and great. 

Now, I can reach my class notes from any browser anywhere. I can make everything I learn interactive and interesting with my own style. There is so much that I will learn as it seems like a whole new world has opened up to me; like how it was when I could see underwater with goggles for the first time. I am excited to see how I can execute my artistry in this format and to grow from this point forward into lucrative and modern businesses. 

The Prework consists of the basics of HTML, CSS, GitHub and JavaScript and how to open the terminal and run git commands; also how to open a code editor and how to add extensions to the editor. Lots of other complicated stuff like Math functions and randomTopics on the console- yikes. Lol. Mostly I learned that I don't know anything, but that I can learn anything!
