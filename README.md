## Description

Created this website to get my feet wet and understand some of the terminology of what was expected of me in the upcoming immersive classes. I built this project because I need it for maximum learning capabilities. I am extremely happy with the results as I have come a long way in such a short time just by following the directions in the tutorial and meeting with a tutor whenever there was an issue. The student support of this boot camp is unbelievable. 

Now, I can reach my class notes from any browser anywhere. I can make everything I learn interactive and interesting with my own style. There is so much that I will learn as it seems like a whole new world has opened up to me; like how it was when I could see underwater with goggles for the first time. I am excited to see how I can execute mastery in artistry in this format and to grow from this point forward into lucrative and modern businesses. 

With these new tools, it seems possible to show my real talent that has been gestating for a few decades. I learned a few amazing things, the basics of HTML, CSS, GitHub, JavaScript. I now understand how to open the terminal and run git commands, also how to open a code editor and how to add extensions to the editor. Then I learned about things that will ultimately need more time and training such as the Math elements and the randomTopics concept in Javascript. It was exciting. There is so much I learned that I don't know, wow, I can't put it into this Description.
